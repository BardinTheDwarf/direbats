Direbats are neutral flying mobs that spawn in caves and other dark places. 

## Spawning
Direbats can spawn in up to groups of 4 in the Overworld. They will only spawn at a light level of 4 or less. If the date on the player's computer is between October 20th and November 3rd, Direbats will instead spawn in the Overworld at a light level of 7 or less.

## Drops
When killed by a player, Direbats drop 0â€“2 [Direbat Fangs](Direbat_Fang). The maximum drop is increased by 0-4 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-14 with Looting III.
### Equipment
Direbats always drop their held item(s) on death.
### Experience
Direbats drop 5 experience points on death.

## Behavior
### Attacking the player
Direbats will only attack the player if the brightness level is higher than 4 or the player has attacked the Direbat first. A Direbat will inflict 5 seconds of {% include mcwiki.html url="Blindness" title="Blindness" %} on the hit entity, or 10 seconds if the {% include mcwiki.html url="Difficulty" title="difficulty" %} is set to hard.
### Picking up items
Direbats will find and go after item entities nearby and pick them up. A Direbat will drop its held item if it takes damage in any way, or targets an entity.
